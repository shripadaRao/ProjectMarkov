                        Simple NLP based project without any use of AI
                               (Application of Markov Chains)



Intro (What I'm actually doing):<br><div>
        Scrape Reddit(r/LifeProTips and r/ULPT) for content. Collect data and process them for NLP. Use Markov Chains to generate content using the processed data. Build a website to publish/host the same.
</div>

Use case:
        To generate stuff(Content)

What I'll Learn in the end of the project:
        <ul>
  <li>Website Scrapping</li>
  <li>Working of Markov Chains</li>
  <li>Django</li>
  <li>Git and Github</li>
</ul> 

Steps for Completion:
1) Scrape Reddit(r/LifeProTips) for Content. --done
2) Store the scrapped content into a csv file. --done
3) Pre Process the data for NLP work. --doing
4) Work on Markov Chain
5) Work on Web Dev(Django) 
6) Deploy the Django Site
