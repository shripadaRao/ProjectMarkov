Intro(What I'm actually doing):
        Scrape Reddit(r/LifeProTips and r/UnethicalLifeProTips) for content. Collect data and process them for NLP. Use Markov Chains to generate content using the processed data. Build a website to publish/host the same.


Use case:

What I'll Learn in the end of the project:
        >Website Scrapping
        >Working of Markov Chains
        >Django
        >Git and Github
